# RiceChecks: "RPN" Example

This repo is a demonstration project for the [RiceChecks](https://github.com/RiceComp215-Staff/RiceChecks/) Java autograder.

In this hypothetical project, students are asked to implement a simple RPN calculator; there are many cases, so we require minimum test coverage.

The initial state of this repository has all tests passing. Feel free to introduce bugs to the student assignment and see how RiceChecks responds.

## Gitpod

Here's a link that will drop you into the Gitpod web-based IDE using this codebase:
- https://gitpod.io/github.com/RiceComp215-Staff/RiceChecks-RpnExample

(You can replace this URL with any public GitHub repository with `gitpod.io` before the usual `github.com`. You might do this with your personal copy resulting from the GitHub Classroom process, above.)

From the Gitpod terminal shell, run `./gradlew autograder`. 

## GitHub Actions
                                                                                                                                         
If you're a beta-tester for GitHub Actions, this repository is configured to run the autograder as a GitHub Action on every push. You can see the results of the autograder by clicking the "Commits" tab. Try introducing bugs, committing and pushing, to see how RiceChecks responds.
