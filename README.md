# RiceChecks: "RPN" Example

This repo is a demonstration project for the [RiceChecks](https://github.com/RiceComp215-Staff/RiceChecks/) Java autograder.

In this hypothetical project, students are asked to implement a simple RPN calculator;
there are many cases, so we require minimum test coverage.

The initial state of this repository has all tests passing. Feel free
to introduce bugs to the student assignment and see how RiceChecks responds.

## GitHub Classroom / GitHub Actions

You can clone this project using the following GitHub Classroom link:
- https://classroom.github.com/a/X4Ez6Tno

Your clone repo will be publicly visible and will appear in the `RiceChecks-Demo`
GitHub organization, which is configured to use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
This will run the autograder automatically every time you push to the repository. 
You will be able to see this in action by clicking on the "Commits" tab.

## Gitpod

Here's a link that will drop you into the Gitpod web-based IDE using
this codebase:
- https://gitpod.io/github.com/RiceComp215-Staff/RiceChecks-RpnExample

(You can replace this URL with any public GitHub repository with
`gitpod.io` before the usual `github.com`. You might do this
with your personal copy resulting from the GitHub Classroom
process, above.)

From the Gitpod terminal shell, run `./gradlew autograder`.
